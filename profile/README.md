# Gnolabs

> Building practical AI operators for real-world execution.

Gnolabs designs and ships agent systems that combine strategy, operations, and automation into production workflows.

## What We Build

- **AI operator systems** for execution, coordination, and decision support
- **Multi-agent workflows** with clear ownership and handoff protocols
- **Operational tooling** for reliability, observability, and incident response
- **Voice and messaging interfaces** for natural human ↔ agent collaboration

## Current Focus

- **P0:** Multi-agent voice interface (real-time STT/TTS + agent routing)
- **P1:** Persistent memory services for cross-session continuity
- **P1:** Governance and security controls for safe agent operations

## Engineering Standards

- Security-first defaults
- Observable systems (metrics, runbooks, alerting)
- Deterministic workflows where reliability matters
- Clear ownership and documented operating cadence

## Repositories

- [`openclaw-memory-service`](https://github.com/Gnolabs/openclaw-memory-service) — memory + voice initiative planning and implementation

## Brand

Gnolabs visual identity uses a clean technical aesthetic: deep navy, electric cyan, and neutral graphite with high-contrast accessibility.

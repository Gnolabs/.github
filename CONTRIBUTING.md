# Contributing to Gnolabs

Thanks for contributing. We optimize for reliable execution, clear ownership, and secure defaults.

## Workflow
1. Open an issue first (bug, feature, or RFC).
2. Keep PRs scoped and reviewable.
3. Reference the issue in your PR (`Closes #<id>` when appropriate).

## Standards
- Use conventional commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, etc.).
- Add tests/docs for behavior changes.
- Avoid introducing secrets into code, logs, or docs.
- Prefer deterministic behavior over clever behavior.

## PR Checklist
- [ ] Problem statement is clear
- [ ] Scope is minimal and intentional
- [ ] Security/privacy impact considered
- [ ] Observability impact considered
- [ ] Rollback path documented for risky changes
